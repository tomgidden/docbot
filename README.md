# _pdfulator_, a Markdown to PDF converter

**https://github.com/tomgidden/pdfulator**

## Introduction

`pdfulator` is a Markdown-to-PDF converter using:

- _[Docker](https://docker.com)_ - a containerization engine
- _[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)_ - a document format converter
- _[PagedJS](https://pagedjs.org)_ - an library for paginating HTML
- _[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org)_ - a PDF renderer ;)
- some CSS, fonts, and some minor glue scripts.

It's not rocket science, but it's fiddly and usually not worth spending the time to assemble into a single utility.  That's what this is for.


## Installation

The utility is packaged as a Docker image, as the dependencies are messy. You can pull down the image from Docker Hub:

```zsh
docker pull tomgidden/pdfulator
docker tag tomgidden/pdfulator pdfulator
```

or you can build it yourself. To build the image, run:

```zsh
make build
```

or manually:

```zsh
docker build -t pdfulator .
```

Due to the inclusion of _Chromium_ the image footprint is large.

## Usage

Given a Markdown file `foo.md`, if you have the GNUmakefile in the current folder, you can run:

```zsh
make foo.pdf
```

or the hard way:

```zsh
docker run --rm --init -i tomgidden/pdfulator - < foo.md > foo.pdf
```

That's it. For continuous update whenever the Markdown changes, run:

```zsh
make watch
```

or the hard way:

```zsh
docker run --rm --init -v $(pwd):/in tomgidden/pdfulator --watch
```

## Customisation and development

### Immediate single-file mode

```zsh
DEBUG=1 make foo.pdf
```

That should do three things:

- Use the current `defaults` folder rather than the baked-in copy in the Docker image;
- Use the current folder's `entrypoint.sh` rather than the baked-in copy in the Docker image;
- Preserve the intermediate `tmp` folder, containing the generated HTML file.

As a result, you can tweak the CSS and other things in `defaults` and quickly see the result without having to rebuild the Docker image.

For example, a dev workflow might look like this:

```zsh
DEBUG=1 make -B foo.pdf && open foo.pdf
```

or even better, just use watch mode:

```zsh
DEBUG=1 make watch
```

Once you're happy with the style, you can build your own version of the image and use it anywhere without having to also transfer any assets.

## Styling

The current CSS is a simple Humanist "white-paper" layout typical of my general tastes. I was influenced in my youth by the original [1995 Java™ white paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20240524160851/https://www.stroustrup.com/1995_Java_whitepaper.pdf)s and other documentation from Sun, and this is somewhat simplified version. It's very rough-and-ready, but it does enough for me right now.  I have been wondering if it's worth having multiple themes somehow.

You can override the styling by adding a `theme` folder with custom stylesheets, fonts and other assets. This should override the ones in `defaults`:

```zsh
EXTRA_DOCKER_OPTS="-v $(pwd)/my_css:/theme" make foo.pdf
```


## Document metadata

To support the top front-matter in a Markdown file, you can include a YAML block at the top of the file delineated by `---` and `...`; see this `README.yaml` file for an example.

Unfortunately, other Markdown renderers (notably _[GitHub](https://github.com/tomgidden/pdfulator)_) may include this as garbled nonsense in their output.

If this bothers you, you can include the YAML as a separate file next to the Markdown instead, eg. `foo.md` and `foo.yaml`.

### Metadata entries

- `title` - The title of the document. If not included, the first top-level heading (`#`) in the document will be hoisted to the title. It seems weird to leave the title out of the bare Markdown, but this hoisting behaviour is a little unusual.

- `date` - A block containing `month` and `year` to be displayed in the front-matter.

- `revision` - A revision number, to be displayed in the front-matter and the footer.

- `copyright` - An optional copyright attribution to be included in the page footer.  If set, it will be preceded by '©', the year (determined either from `date.year` or `year` in the metadata, or the current year), and then the attribution.

- `footer` - An optional text to be included in the page footer, added to the copyright if there is one.

- `pdfulator_features` - [See below](#pdfulator_features)

### Example metadata

```yaml
title: Set this or just let it use the first `#`

- no_wide
- no_wide_pre
- shade_monospace
- strong_monospace
- narrow_monospace
```

### `pdfulator_features`

The document metadata [see above](#document-metadata) can include a `pdfulator_features` line or list that contains a few optional choices controlling formatting.  These can be left in but ignored (ie. disabled) by prefixing them with `no_`, or just removing them.

These include:

- `wide` - Don't indent the main body text. This gives extra space, useful especially for pre- and code-blocks, but at the expense of the left margin.

- `wide_pre` - Don't _further_ indent pre-formatted text blocks.  Again, extra space, but less easily read.

- `shade_monospace`, `shade_pre`, `shade_code` - Use a light grey background for monospaced font material, or just block (`_pre`) or inline (`_code`) sections. This is to further distinguish from the main text.

- `strong_monospace`, `strong_pre`, `strong_code` - Use a bolder font for monospaced. By default it uses a lighter font to try to distinguish from body text, but this goes the other way.

- `narrow_monospace` - Use a narrower font for monospaced content, to try to get it to fit nicely on a page.

- `justify` - Use full justification for body text. I like this, but some of my designer friends say it's bad and ragged edge makes for better typography.

- `strong_href` -- embolden hyperlinks to make them stand out.

## Adding a logo

If there is a file `logo.svg` in the `theme` folder, it will be used in the top-right header box.

# TODO

[ ] _TOCs_

[ ] _Better images_. You can put things in the `theme` folder that can then be referenced for use in `DEBUG=1`, and you can (presumably) use remote URL files.  However, there's no easy way to pass them into the container for processing at this time.  More thought needed.

[ ] _Improved layout_. This is still a work in progress.

[X] _Themes_.  

[ ] _Built-in themes_. Instead of having to make a theme, have some premade ones available with settings in metadata.

[ ] _Comprehensive support for the format_

[ ] _HTML_, _EPUB_, etc. Given the use of _Pandoc_ these should be very simple to support. I'm just an old fart that likes neat A4 documents even if I never actually print them out.

[ ] Testing of `--watch` and improvement on file globbing and so on.

Any feedback, assistance or code contributions welcome.

# History

I've had various DocBook or Markdown to PDF toolchains using XSL-FO, Apache FOP and other tech since the late nineties, usually named "docbot" as I used them in web and email services, Slack bots, etc. 

There are a lot of projects called `docbot` and a lot called `md2pdf`. None of them do exactly what I want, though. Decent pagination was served by the DocBook XSL sheets, but HTML-based ones have been lacking. Most still do. 

 And using DocBook as an intermediary is a bad idea; while DocBook is richer than Markdown (and arguably a far better choice for software documentation) the element semantics aren't suitable for generic documents.

[PagedJS](https://pagedjs.org) now seems to make the HTML route a good option, being a capable polyfill for the print features of CSS3, allowing for running headers and footers and so on.

- v1.0: Released for a short time as "docbot"

- v1.1: Renamed to "pdfulator" and refactored to give a basic "--watch" mode. This is still a work in progress.

- v1.1.1: Themes

# Licence

I hereby release the parts of this project I have written freely under [Creative Commons CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1).  Attribution and code contributions would be nice though.

This clearly does not apply for the third-party sub-components it uses or the fonts in the `assets` folder which are released under their own licences: [OFL](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/LICENSE) and the GUST/LPPL licence as appropriate.

I've included the fonts (and their licences) in this package purely for performance and simplicity: otherwise they either need to be downloaded on each invocation, or cached somehow between Docker runs, leaving junk on the host machine. I hope that's okay within the terms of those licences.
